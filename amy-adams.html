Moreover, hеr ѕіgnіfісаnt fіrѕt раrt wаѕ іn Саtсh Ме Іf Yоu Саn tоgеthеr.</h3><h2><span id=Is_Amy_married>Is Amy married?</span></h2><p>Amy Adams and Darren Le Gallo first crossed paths in an acting class, but the timing wasn’t right. “I had another boyfriend, and Darren was dating some girl,” she told Vanity Fair in 2008. “I did scenes with him, and I liked him and thought he was really sweet.” But she didn’t see him as boyfriend material just yet.</p><p>The two didn’t start dating until they acted together in Pennies, a short film. “I got to know him outside of class,” Amy said Vanity Fair. “And I just found him to be such a genuine, caring person.” And he’d become more “assertive” since they’d first met. “He demanded that we go out on a date. He replied, ‘I know you’re getting over this [other] guy, but I’m taking you out on Wednesday,'” she recalled to the publication. “…And I was like, ‘And so you are!'”</p><h4><span>Amy and Le Gallo made their first public appearance at the Oscars!</span></h4><p>Soon after she snagged her first Oscar nom for her supporting actress role as Ashley in Junebug, she and Le Gallo attended their first major award ceremony as a couple. She didn’t take home the Academy Award that night but was celebrating with Le Gallo at the Vanity Fair after-party.</p><p>Finally, after dating for six years, Le Gallo reportedly popped the question around April. Of course, she said yes, but didn’t announce the news until late July and kept mum on the proposal’s details. She cleared up one thing in her VF interview at the time though: “No, I’m not pregnant. I can confirm. I’ve been engaged for four months. I think we’d know!”</p><h4><span>Their first child</span></h4><p>Adams gave birth to their daughter, Aviana Olea Le Gallo, the couple’s first child, on May 15, 2010. “Mom and baby are home and doing great,” her rep said People at the time. “Everyone’s healthy and happy.” Since then, Le Gallo has shared multiple pictures of Aviana, calling her “the best gift” and referring to her and Amy as “my two angels.”</p><h4><span>About their marriage</span></h4><p>And after 13 years together, she and Gallo had a classic spring wedding. They always wanted to get married “in spring or fall” but had to keep pushing their wedding plans back because of her jam-packed work schedule. “I want something very family-oriented and laid-back,” Amy told Vanity Fair in 2013.</p><p>When they finally tied the knot, it was just as they’d hoped: a “small, intimate ceremony” at a close friend’s house outside of Santa Barbara, California. Though the nuptials were a top-secret, no-photo affair, the publication reported that she wore a Marchesa gown.</p><p>Moreover, she received her Hollywood Walk of Fame star with Le Gallo, Aviana, and her mom at her side. Throughout her entire career, Le Gallo has been she unwavering support system. Many people have asked her if it is difficult to manage life when both of them are actors. However, she said that it worked well because they were both quiet people and balance each other.</p><p>“He’s not competitive with me,” Amy said Vanity Fair in that same 2008 story. “He has a wonderful talent, and there aren’t many people in the world who are like that, where he does not think that my success is his failure. He just doesn’t see it like that, and I don’t either.”</p><p>She quoted that sentiment in a 2016 interview with The Guardian: “…He travels with me and helps to keep the family together, and I really do appreciate that. But I don’t value it because he’s a man doing it, I value it because he’s my partner… My husband is an extremely competent caregiver.”</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-31190 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amy-Adams-fam.jpg alt="Amy Adams" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-31190 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Amy Adams and her family at Hollywood Walk of Fame Ceremony.

So, for me, I don’t think like that. I don’t associate that with myself at this time. I’ve been working, which is so grounding and you don’t sort of getting a sense of the outside world when you’re working.”</p><h4><span>‘Doubt’ and ‘American Hustle’</span></h4><p>She has continued to take on an array of roles to much acclaim, earning Academy Award nominations for roles in the dramas The Fighter (2010), directed by David O.
