However, he had no intention to follow the format and went unbeaten, untied, and unscored upon through six rounds of racing.</p><p>He defeated Dennis Bailey in the finale for $100,000 and went home victorious. In total, he pocketed $135,000.</p><p>“We went wanting to win, but the expectation was to go rounds…we certainly didn’t think we were going to win it undefeated.

Later on, he transitioned to ’68 Mustang that helped him win against the best of the best in the Street Outlaws.</p><p>His journey started just by watching TV which turned into a real-life dream come true.</p><p>“This journey all started with No Prep Kings…that car was just going to be on the track, but things changed and we wanted to race. The street was the next thing, and we had to conquer it,” Brandon says.</p><p>While Brandon had a friendly acceleration competition with his fellow racers in Southern California, he had never tested racing Mustang in the street race. Nevertheless, he join the race with a belief that his Mustang was better than everyone else’s and eventually proved it right.</p><p>Brandon represents Solar Need Racing and is the only driver for the team. Besides racing, the company also provides services such as solar projects, durable and renewable roofing systems, and residential and commercial construction.</p><p>Brandon built his mustang with a California Street Machine that helped power the car with a twin-turbo 421 CID block Chevrolet. The family-owned company specialized in precision machine work and exacting tolerances and has a long history in the racing industry.</p><p>Over the years, he has competed in various tracks. For him, Sacramento is his hometown track only an hour and a half away. He and his team worked hard to make it to every race. The longest he ever drove was 6 hours to be in a race, only to wait 4 days in the rain to never get to race at all.</p><p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Brandon had crashed his car and his friend Dan came for the save.
