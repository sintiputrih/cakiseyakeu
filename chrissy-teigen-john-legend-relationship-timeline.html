She said: <strong>"We were on a music video set all day together and then I went to one of his shows and then … yeah …"</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4b741c8158d-gettyimages-609663868.jpg><p id=emjjXBg-gV_ data-wc=93>Despite their fiery start, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Chrissy told&nbsp;Cosmopolitan</a>&nbsp;in 2014 that after their first meeting, she played it cool with the All of Me&nbsp;singer. <strong>"I left him by himself for a while.</strong> The worst thing you can do is try to lock someone like that down early on, then have them think, 'There's so much more out there.' I played it cool for a long time. <strong>Never once did I ask, 'What are we?</strong>' Marriage was never my goal because I've never been very traditional. <strong>I was just happy to be with him."</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>How long have Chrissy and John been together?</h2><p id=eP3xqyvzkMi data-wc=41><strong>Since their first meeting in 2006, the couple has stayed together</strong>, although, Chrissy revealed that <strong>John did try to call it quits for a very brief moment</strong> which she spoke about in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian&nbsp;in 2017.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=e2gkQJfw7eb data-wc=48>Addressing the situation on Twitter, she said:<strong>&nbsp;"It wasn't a typical breakup," she continued in a follow-up tweet.

But their nuptials weren't all smooth sailing. A storm hit on the day, meaning that John's family wouldn't have made it to their destination wedding in time, so the couple decided to push back their vows until everyone had arrived.</p><p id=eA4lGS4uubl data-wc=51>Their special day saw the supermodel donning<strong>&nbsp;three unbelievable wedding dresses</strong>. The first was<strong>&nbsp;a flawless ivory strapless open-back tulle skirted Vera Wang ballgown.</strong> The second, was an <strong>on-trend fishtail style design, again in the perfect bridal hue of ivory,</strong> and also featured a micro-pleated bodice and sheared organza full skirt.</p><p id=e8K6b9cGEDi data-wc=62>The third was another <strong>Vera Wang number but this time it was in a dark romantic hue of crimson.</strong> Like the second dress, Chrissy opted for a mermaid style and, of course, looked so beautiful.

I was going to. just never got around to it&nbsp;</strong>and it isn't even the name he goes by. it wasn't some grand statement not to. I just don't see how the choice affects anyone else - why do people care so much!"</p><h2 dir=ltr>When did Chrissy and John become parents?</h2><p id=exBCssGCVf1P data-wc=54>Chrissy and John are the adoring parents to<strong>&nbsp;L</strong><strong>una, 11, whom they welcomed in 2016, Miles, four, whom they welcomed in 2018, and baby Estie whom the pair welcomed in January this year.</strong> The couple lost their son, Jack, in September 2022, and later welcomed a fourth child in June 2023 via a surrogate.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e55824ef33e5-chrissyteigen34030756561750954592230241419039442227616119n.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>What happened to John and Chrissy's son?</h2><p id=e7dwW_Nxv5EI data-wc=46>Chrissy was 20 weeks pregnant when she lost Jack due to a pregnancy complication.

Taking to Instagram to announce the arrival of their little one, Chrissy posted an emotional message which in part read: "For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted four children. As a little girl, 2 glow worms and 2 cabbage patch dolls were perpetually in my arms, helping me stir in my pretend kitchen, watching Alf with me.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezHpL6nNm9 data-wc=55><strong>"After losing Jack, I didn't think I'd be able to carry any more babies on my own. To be honest, I've personally blocked out a lot of my mindset during that time, but one clear memory is being surrounded by people who wanted to make sure I wouldn't go through that pain and loss again."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d7ff0e2628c5-chrissy-teigen-baby-wren.jpg><p id=efseVOrZoU data-wc=42>Touching on her surrogacy experience, Chrissy went on to say: "In 2021, we reached out to a surrogacy agency, with our first correspondence inquiring about perhaps having 2 tandem surrogates, to each bring us a healthy baby boy or girl.
