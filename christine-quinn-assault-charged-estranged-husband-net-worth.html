Quinn quit The Oppenheim Group to open her firm, RealOpen with her now-estranged husband, Christian Dumontet (known as Christian Richard on the <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> show). Since her exit, she's taken the fashion world by storm – walking the runway for brands like Balenciaga and posing for magazine covers.</p><p>She also published her "self-help book" How to Be a Boss B*tch, where she opened up about <a href=#>her dark history of dating sugar daddies</a>. Despite her bad experiences with dating wealthy men, she remains an advocate of marrying rich. Unfortunately, her millionaire husband filed for divorce after he was arrested, twice, following a "domestic dispute".

He "threw a bag containing a glass bottle at the victim," referring to Quinn.</strong> But <strong>he missed and injured their 3-year-old son, Christian Georges instead</strong>. The reality star agreed to a seven-day protective order against her husband. But after posting a $30,000 bail the following day, the tech entrepreneur was arrested again after returning home and violating the protective order.</p><p>Christine Quinn's friends set her up with Christian Dumontet after completing season 1 of Selling Sunset .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quinn immediately filed a temporary restraining order, alleging Dumontet of being "volatile and erratic" throughout their relationship. As it turned out, <strong>she'd told him about her "dissatisfaction" with their marriage leading up to the incident</strong>. He then began yelling and throwing heavy things at her, like "heavy floral arrangements." She alleged that <strong>"he narrowly missed hitting me with one of the metal rods, but I was struck by one of boxes he threw."</strong></p><p>"He then opened a can of Red Bull and threw that across the room as well, making more of a mess … and returned a short time later, and threw dog feces at me, which he pulled out of the trash."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one point, <strong>Quinn said Dumontet "pulled out his penis and began to urinate on the floor."</strong> She then hid in the master bathroom with her son, feeling "terrified" for their safety during the altercation. The next day, the latter picked a fight again. "<strong>While I was working, I heard, and felt the rush of air from an object hurtling towards me and our son</strong>. The next instant I heard what sounded like glass breaking," the model recalled.</p><p><strong>Quinn "saw broken glass in our son's hair and on the floor" and "after a few seconds, our son burst into tears and began screaming. I was concerned about his health and safety."</strong> Within minutes, LAPD police officers responded to what they ruled a "domestic dispute".</p><p>In her filing for a temporary restraining order, Quinn mentioned that <strong>Dumontet went to ​"extreme measures to prevent me from leaving the property" and to "isolate me and our son."</strong> He even locked the front security gate of their home "so <strong>we physically cannot leave the property</strong>." Her request was approved by a judge on March 28.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dumontet also filed a restraining order against Quinn, but the judge denied his request because his claims "do not show a reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse." On April 5, <strong>Dumontet filed for divorce, which Quinn seemingly addressed via X (formerly Twitter)</strong>. <strong>"Trash always takes itself out," she wrote</strong> on May 9.</p><p>Christine Quinn and Christian Dumontet spent "over a million dollars" on their gothic winter wonderland wedding in 2019.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ttweb_jason-oppenheim-hated-filming-selling-sunset-season-7_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why Jason Oppenheim Really Struggled Filming Selling Sunset's Season 7 ">Why Jason Oppenheim Really Struggled Filming Selling Sunset's Season 7</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jason Oppenheim was just a background character for Netflix's Selling Sunset, until he became involved with Chrishell Stause in season 5.</p><h2 id=christine-quinn-39-s-estranged-millionaire-husband-owes-100-000-in-hospital-bills-from-their-son-39-s-birth>Christine Quinn's Estranged Millionaire Husband Owes $100,000 In Hospital Bills From Their Son's Birth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fff.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, <strong>Dumontet has a net worth of $20 million</strong>.

When asked about her special relationships with wealthy men before, the Selling Sunset alum said, <strong>"There's a huge stigma to [being a sugar baby]," adding, "It's two consenting adults, and women are so ashamed of that." </strong>She said the book was meant to inspire women to bank on "expressing themselves."</p><p>"I want women, and everyone, to use their platform, their sexuality, their whatever, to express themselves," Quinn explained. "Even OnlyFans—if that's something you want to do, why should you be shamed of that?"</p><p>She continued: "When we were writing the book, I was advised not to talk about it. But I say what I want to say, and there's absolutely no shame in it at all." But <strong>despite being "in a relationship with a wonderful man who was great to me," Quinn "learned along the way that I didn't want to be a housewife." </strong>She joked, "I mean, a <a href=#><strong>Real Housewife</strong></a><strong> </strong>of Beverly Hills, maybe— but<strong> that life took away my freedom</strong>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then clarified that the book aims "to educate people on how to do <strong>[date rich men] right—if you're gonna settle down like that, make sure you have your own side hustle</strong>." Talking about her then-new marriage to Dumontet, Quinn said she "had to build my kingdom before my prince came to me. I was doing really well in real estate, I was on a television show, and that's when he came to me." She then ended her statement with a rather philosophical quote:</p><p>"It's my belief that it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it is with a poor man. So, why not go rich?"</p><p>"My grandma told me that. She was the most fabulous woman, my mom as well," Quinn shared. But when asked if she wanted to finish her studies, which she had to skip due to financial issues growing up, the reality star proudly responded: "That would go against everything I believe in."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"People don't need to go to a fancy school to accomplish their dreams," she argued. "<strong>I have this street smarts and this hustle that cannot be taught at MIT, Harvard, or Yale. No master's degree in the world can make up for the experiences that I've had throughout my life</strong>." We're sure fans can't wait for a post-divorce tell-all or a new solo reality show.</p><p>Christine Quinn has a net worth of $3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqusRmqK6hnqN6or%2FSmqylrF2YtaK%2Bxp6bZp2jqb%2Biusaem2agpaivorrDZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchristine-quinn-assault-charged-estranged-husband-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchristine-quinn-assault-charged-estranged-husband-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchristine-quinn-assault-charged-estranged-husband-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchristine-quinn-assault-charged-estranged-husband-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchristine-quinn-assault-charged-estranged-husband-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchristine-quinn-assault-charged-estranged-husband-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./johnny-wactor-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./johnny-wactor-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating.html>Johnny Wactor Girlfriend: Who Is He Dating?
