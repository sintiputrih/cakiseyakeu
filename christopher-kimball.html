Who is Christopher Kimball’s wife?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Christopher Kimball is an American television personality and chef who gained fame as the host of the show America’s Test Kitchen.</p><p>He is also the founder and editor of Milk Street.</p><h2><strong>Biography</strong></h2><p>He was born on June 5, 1951, in&nbsp;Rye, New York, USA.</p><p>Christopher grew up on a farm in Vermont,</p><p>Kimball started to cook as a young child. ”Started baking when I was 7 or 8 – the first recipe was a chocolate cake with 7-Minute Frosting that ended up with the consistency of snot,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Daring Gourmet</a>.</p><p>In 1973, Christopher earned his degree in Primitive Art from Columbia University.</p><p>In 1980, he launched Cook’s Magazine.</p><p>In 1989, Kimball sold the magazine to the privately held Swedish media group, Bonnier Group.</p><h2><strong>ATK</strong></h2><p>In 1993, Kimball was a co-founder of America’s Test Kitchen.</p><p>For the first 16 seasons, he also served as a host of the cooking show America’s Test Kitchen.</p><p>In January 2011, he started to host WGBH-FM’s America’s Test Kitchen Radio.</p><p>Kimball and America’s Test Kitchen parted ways in 2015.</p><p>”We made every effort to offer Chris a reasonable contract that reflected his significant contributions to the company and are disappointed that we could not reach agreement,” stated Boston Common Press (the parent company of America’s Test Kitchen) CEO David Nussbaum.</p><p>In January 2017, <a href=#>Julia Collin Davison</a> and <a href=#>Bridget Lancaster</a> began hosting the cooking show.</p><h2><strong>Milk Street</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Kimball created Christopher Kimball’s Milk Street, a food media publishing company in Boston that has a public television show, magazine with tested recipes, radio show, and cooking classes.</p><p>Milk Street was funded by a&nbsp;$6 million investment.</p><p>The company has its location at the Flour and Grain Exchange building at 177 Milk Street.&nbsp;</p><p>”Our mission is to rethink how we should cook at home,” Kimball said in January 2018 for <a href=# rel=noopener>The Kitchn</a>. ”We’re trying to bridge that gap between how people really cook and how we design cookware. We want to make our recipes as easy as possible with a limited number of ingredients.”</p><h2><strong>Lawsuit</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-36468 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Christopher-Kimball-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt="Christopher Kimball Net Worth" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Christopher-Kimball-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-36468 class=wp-caption-text>© Guliver / Getty Images</p><p>In October 2016, the company behind America’s Test Kitchen filed a lawsuit against Christopher in Suffolk Superior Court, accusing him of ripping off America’s Test Kitchen concept for Milk Street and using company resources while working on launching Milk Street.</p><p>Additionally, he was accused of ”stealing” at least 15 former America’s Test Kitchen employees.</p><p>The lawsuit says: ”Mr. Kimball spent the last year of his employment with America’s Test Kitchen creating a new venture which literally and conceptually ripped off America’s Test Kitchen.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jack Bishop, the chief creative officer at ATK, <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>: ”He kept on saying he wasn’t going to compete.” Jack added: ”I took him at his word. I think everyone on the board was taking him at his word.”</p><p>In late 2016, Christopher countersued and claimed that the lawsuit cost his company ”millions of dollars in possible investments.” Furthermore, he accused America’s Test Kitchen of using the lawsuit as a ”nationwide media campaign” that defamed him.</p><p>Kimball was also sued by Milk Street Cafe, a restaurant owned by Marc Epstein, for trademark infringement. In 2017, a federal judge ruled in Kimball’s favor.</p><p>In August 2019, it was reported that Kimball and ATK had settled their lawsuit. As part of the settlement, Christopher has returned his shares in America’s Test Kitchen to the company.</p><p>”Recouping Mr. Kimball’s shares in ATK was very important for the growth and future of the company,” said ATK in a statement.</p><p>”I think sometimes you just have to move on,” Kimball declared. He went on to say: ”I think it would have been awkward still being there as a partner.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>MatPat Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>In December 2012, Christopher divorced his second wife, Adrienne.
