At the time, Wilson was armed with a handgun and rifle and wore a bulletproof vest.</p><p>Upon arriving at the location, police found Wilson barricaded inside the home with the two women.&nbsp;</p><p>What followed was a hostage negotiation that went on for several hours.</p><p>However, as several agencies, including the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, Pearl Police, Madison Police, and at least one SWAT team, responded, Wilson began firing at the police.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Police and Wilson exchange fire</h2><p>Gabriel Mathew Wilson shooting led to the injury of one Brandon police officer.</p><p>For hours, Wilson remained barricaded inside the home with the woman he was holding hostage.&nbsp;</p><p>When they convinced him to release the second woman, the situation seemed to be settling down, but a few hours later, Wilson began a deadly exchange of fire with the police.</p><p>Several shots were fired, and Officer Randy Tyler was fatally injured alongside Wilson, ending the standoff at approximately 10 am on June 1, 2023. &nbsp;</p><p>The injured officer was taken to the University of Mississippi Medical Center, where his condition stabilized.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Police investigate the shooting</h2><p>The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is investigating the incident, and they will gather all available evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon completion, their findings will be submitted to the Attorney General’s Office. The Bureau will also look into Wilson’s background.&nbsp;</p><p>It is unclear whether Wilson had a previous criminal record or had been held for any prior crimes. The motives behind the incident remain unknown.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wilson’s family react to the tragic end</h2><p>The tragic incident has left Wilson’s family devastated and shocked. Speaking to several news sources, his family said that Wilson was a kind-hearted and gentle person.&nbsp;</p><p>They could not fathom what had led him to take such violent measures that led to his death and that of a police officer.</p><p>Tyler was only months away from retirement and had served as the police chief of the Ridgeland Police Department for 27 years before joining the Madison Police Department.&nbsp;</p><p>Governor Tate Reeves posted a tweet honoring Officer Tyler’s sacrifice on his <a href=#>Twitter</a> account.</p><p>According to his colleagues, he was an exceptional officer with vast experience in law enforcement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Community pays respect to Tyler</h2><p>Following Tyler’s tragic death, several people paid tribute to him on social media.</p><p>The Madison Police Department, where Tyler served as part of a special response team, leading recruit training, posted a touching tribute via Facebook, saying that he will be deeply missed by all of his colleagues, family, and friends.</p><p>The city of Ridgeland, where Tyler worked for many years, also issued a statement offering condolences to his family.&nbsp;</p><p>They added that his service to their community from 1987 to 2015 will not be forgotten. Mississippi’s Attorney General also paid tribute to Tyler, describing him as an exceptional officer.</p><p>Gabriel Matthew Wilson actions on June 1 cannot be justified in any way.</p><p>His violent actions resulted in the death of a police officer and injured another. The apparent <a href=#>motivation</a> for his actions remains unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important for law enforcement agencies to gather as much information as they can to find out what led to his actions and how similar incidents can be prevented in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Officer Tyler’s death is a tragic loss for the law enforcement community, and he will be deeply missed.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCzwJupop2cYrqiwNOhnLBlp565tLvNaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgabriel-matthew-wilson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgabriel-matthew-wilson.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgabriel-matthew-wilson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgabriel-matthew-wilson.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgabriel-matthew-wilson.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgabriel-matthew-wilson.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./infamous-kanye-zone-game-taken-offline-in-light-of-ongoing-controversies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./infamous-kanye-zone-game-taken-offline-in-light-of-ongoing-controversies.html>Infamous Kanye Zone game taken offline in light of ongoing controversies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./did-camilla-parker-bowles-husband-know-about-charles-what-is-the-story-behind-2.html>Did Camilla Parker Bowles Husband Know About Charles?
