Now considered both a singer and songwriter, with roles on shows like Netflix's Sweet Magnolias, Jamie Lynn has been hard at work for several years and that has not gone unnoticed or unrewarded.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Lynn has been nominated several times for the Kids' Choice Awards, Young Artists Awards, and the Young Hollywood Awards. Some of her wins include Favorite TV Actress at the Kids Choice Awards, Favorite Actress at the Kids' Choice Awards Germany, and Best Young Ensemble Performance In A TV Series (Comedy or Drama) at the Young Artist Awards. Even with all of these accolades under her belt, it is difficult to ignore the fact that Spears is incredibly well known for being <strong><a href=#>Britney Spears'</a></strong> younger sister, and that without her help, she may not have the career that she has today.</p><h2 id=jamie-lynn-39-s-first-acting-gig-was-on-crossroads>Jamie Lynn's First Acting Gig Was On Crossroads</h2><p>Jamie Lynn Spears was just eleven years old when she appeared on the big screen for the very first time, courtesy of Crossroads, a film Britney Spears was starring in at the time.</p><p>The film follows three childhood best friends as they travel cross-country and rediscover their friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Jamie Lynn Spears Slated To Appear In New Reality Show">Jamie Lynn Spears Slated To Appear In New Reality Show</a></span></p><p>Britney Spears was the main protagonist in the film, a young woman named Lucy, who is on the hunt to not only find her biological mother, but herself and her independence in the process. Jamie Lynn Spears makes an appearance on the screen as a younger version of the same character.</p><p>The scene shows a young Lucy and her two best friends, Mimi and Kit, putting together a time capsule and burying it, making a promise to each other to open it at midnight the night of their graduation. The scene is very brief, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even IMDB doesn't show Spears as credited in the film</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar44922180-1-2.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even still, this opened the door for Jamie Lynn to enter the acting world, and she began appearing often on the eighth season of Nickelodeon's long-running sketch comedy show All That.</p><p>She was an immediate success on the show, receiving praise from viewers and critics alike for her performance and comedic timing.</p><p>Jamie Lynn Spears worked on all that for its eighth and ninth season but opted not to return for the tenth season in order to work on a project with Nickelodeon that catapulted her into stardom.</p><h2 id=zoey-101-premiered-on-nickelodeon>Zoey 101 Premiered On Nickelodeon</h2><p>By 2004, Jamie Lynn Spears signed a deal with Nickelodeon to star in her own show for the network, and thus Zoey 101 was born. The show followed Zoey and her friends while they attended a boarding school together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Happened To Alexa Nikolas After Her Jamie Lynn Spears Scandal?">What Happened To Alexa Nikolas After Her Jamie Lynn Spears Scandal?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Lynn was incredibly involved in the project, and even Britney Spears helped her write the title song for the show, Follow Me, which Jamie Lynn recorded vocals for. Zoey 101<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">premiered on January 9th 2005</a> and was incredibly successful for Nickelodeon.</p><p>It received rave reviews, specifically from its core demographic, and became one of Nickelodeon's best-performing television shows. It lasted for a total of four seasons, with the third one being the longest at 23 episodes, and came to an end in 2008.</p><p>Zoey 101, much like Jamie Lynn Spears, earned many nominations and even won several awards including Favorite TV Actress at the 2006 Kids' Choice Awards, two Best Young Ensemble Performance In A TV Series (Comedy or Drama) in 2006 and 2007, and a Neox Fan Award for Best Neox Kidz Series in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show helped Jamie Lynn Spears earn a majority of her net worth. While it is unclear exactly how much she was paid per episode, it is assumed that she was well compensated <a href=#>based on the pay other Nickelodeon stars</a>, like Miranda Cosgrove, were getting at the time.</p><h2 id=jamie-lynn-admits-her-sister-helped-her-with-the-show>Jamie Lynn Admits Her Sister Helped Her With The Show</h2><p>Even though the relationship between Jamie Lynn Spears and her sister Britney Spears is <a href=#>on-again-off-again strained</a>, there was a period in time when Jamie Lynn admitted that Britney not only helped her with Zoey 101 but provided positive encouragement as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Britney Spears And Her Sister Jamie Lynn Might Be Getting Along Again">Britney Spears And Her Sister Jamie Lynn Might Be Getting Along Again</a></span></p><p>Jamie Lynn recalls <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her sister helping her with the theme song</a> for the show, saying "The Zoey theme song was something me and my sister were a part of creating. I was like 12, I was nervous to go in the studio. Of course, your big sis is like, 'Get in here and do it!' She cheered me on, and she was a big part of that song in the original version."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And it does seem that early on, Britney Spears was very supportive of her sister's career and vice versa, with the two often being photographed together at award shows and on red carpets, specifically around the time Jamie Lynn was working with Nickelodeon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50085815.jpg><p>So while Jamie Lynn Spears may currently have a successful career based on the work she put in herself, it is hard to deny that her older sister Britney Spears had a hand in not only putting Jamie Lynn on the big screen but helping her with an important part of Zoey 101.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecmapKKdXaHGr7qMrKeemaKoeqOxwqiknmWWlrqwwdJo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-jamie-lynn-spears-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-did-jamie-lynn-spears-become-famous.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-jamie-lynn-spears-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-did-jamie-lynn-spears-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-jamie-lynn-spears-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-jamie-lynn-spears-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./juicy-j-net-worth-158318.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./juicy-j-net-worth-158318.html>Juicy J Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./a-certain-magical-index-watch-order.html>Heres the best A Certain Magical Index watch order</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./a-certain-magical-index-watch-order.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
