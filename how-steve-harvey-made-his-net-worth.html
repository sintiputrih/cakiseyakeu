A perfect example of that is even though Steve has turned Family Feud into a sensation in recent years, <a href=#>he once almost quit the show</a>.Fortunately for Steve and everyone that loves and cares about him, things clearly have worked out for him. A beloved comedian, actor, and television host, it often seems like Steve was born to entertain the masses.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To The Model Steve Harvey Mistakenly Crowned 'Miss Universe'?</a></span>One of the key elements in Steve's success has always been the connection he has developed with his fans. With that in mind, it makes sense that Steve has always been very open about his life with those fans.When it comes to Steve's rise to fame, he has revealed some truly amazing facts about what led to his success. Perhaps the most hilarious fact about his rise is that the world may have missed out on Steve's brilliance if it wasn't for the time the famous comedian got beat up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-is-steve-harvey-worth>How Much Money Is Steve Harvey Worth?</h2><p>If you asked most people to name the busiest people in Hollywood, they would be likely to name people who typically star in multiple movies a year like Samuel L. Jackson, Nicolas Cage, and Danny Trejo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Little-Known Facts Steve Harvey Wants To Keep On The DL</a></span></p><p>While all of those actors deserve credit, it could easily be argued that Steve Harvey actually is the hardest-working star in the entertainment business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steve-harvery-being-interviewed.jpg><p>As of the time of this writing, Steve is credited as the host of Judge Steve Harvey, Steve On Watch, and several different versions of Family Feud. On top of that, Steve often pops up to host events like Miss Universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the things that Steve does on camera would keep him busy enough, he also is credited as an executive producer on most of the shows he hosts. Clearly, Steve's work ethic seems to be tireless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steve-harvey-s-house.jpg><p>Thanks to all of Steve's current gigs and the fact that he worked as an actor and comedian for years, it would be shocking if he wasn't wealthy. According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve has a $200 million fortune</a> to enjoy.</p><h2 id=how-did-steve-harvey-become-famous>How Did Steve Harvey Become Famous?</h2><p>As a result of the fact that Steve Harvey has become so successful, it makes sense that he launched steveharvey.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Are Steve Harvey's Four Daughters, And What Do They Do?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Steve's website, there is a section where fans can learn about the history of his life and career. In that area of his website, Steve explains <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how his rise to fame began</a> from inauspicious beginnings.</p><p>"The road to success was not an easy one. It left Harvey homeless, living in his car and traveling the country for performances. In 1990, he won a national comedy competition which led to his big break on Showtime at the Apollo. From that moment on, Harvey’s career took off."</p><p>While winning that competition and his first Showtime at the Apollo performance definitely launched Steve's career, that leaves out a hilarious chapter of his ascent to fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back during the era of his life when <a href=#>he was living in his car</a>, Steve tried a bunch of different things to make money. For that reason, Steve has worked as an autoworker, an insurance salesman, a carpet cleaner, and a mail carrier in the past.</p><p>On top of all that, it may be hard for some to believe, but Steve once tried to launch a boxing career.</p><p>When Steve films Family Feud, he often takes questions from the audience during breaks. In 2020, Steve's Facebook profile uploaded a video in which one of his fans asked him why he quit boxing. In response, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve told a hilarious story about why he gave up on boxing</a>.</p><p>"I didn't quit boxing. A Puerto Rican stopped me from boxing." "That (explicit) hit me so hard, not only did I not know where I was, I didn't know who I was... I thought I was a white girl."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on that anecdote, it seems very clear that Steve didn't have the talent to become a top-level boxer. However, if Steve didn't get beat up like that, it is easy to imagine him trying to pursue boxing a lot longer.</p><p>If Steve's attempts to pursue comedy were delayed, there is no way to know if things would have turned out for him the way they have. One thing is clear, Steve may have been knocked down during that fight but he certainly got back up, dusted himself off, and found his true calling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqMGmwsRmn5qqpprGbrnAnZxmoJmoeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-steve-harvey-made-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-steve-harvey-made-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-steve-harvey-made-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-steve-harvey-made-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-steve-harvey-made-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-steve-harvey-made-his-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anna-biller-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anna-biller-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Anna Biller Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-was-uncomfortable-when-jimmy-fallon-went-off-script-and-showed-her-eye-surgery.html>Taylor Swift Was Clearly Uncomfortable When Jimmy Fallon Went Off-Script And Showed Footage She Wasn</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-swift-was-uncomfortable-when-jimmy-fallon-went-off-script-and-showed-her-eye-surgery.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
