A source informed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a> that there was nothing serious regarding the former heavyweight champion’s health concerns and that he could be ‘suffering with a sciatica flare-up’ in his back.</p><p>Two years ago, a similar event left him bedridden. Earlier this month, he was seen using a cane to navigate the streets of New York, but it is believed that his condition has deteriorated to the point that he requires wheelchair help.</p><p>According to the story, Mike Tyson was recently videotaped discussing his death with his close buddy and therapist Sean McFarland. The legendary heavyweight boxer stated on the ‘Hotboxin With Mike Tyson’ podcast, “We’re all going to die one day, of course. When I look in the mirror and see those little spots on my face, I think, ‘Wow. My expiration date is drawing near. Really soon. I just want to die consciously. I don’t want to die screaming.

He began by asking, “What is security?” “I’m not sure. Does that imply you will not contract a disease? You can’t be struck by a vehicle? “he inquired. “You may not leap from a bridge?”</p><p>He continued “I always warn individuals that they mistakenly believe that wealth will bring them happiness. They had never been wealthy before. When you are wealthy, you cannot expect anyone to adore you. How will I declare my love for you when you have $500 billion dollars? The sense of illusory security. You doubt the possibility of a financial collapse. You mistakenly feel you are invisible when you have a lot of money. I usually remark that money is a false sense of security for this reason.”</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Lady Gaga Shares Her Battle With Fibromyalgia</a></li><li><a href=#>Scott Pelley Illness: A Current Status On His Health And Wellness</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfnrmtusSsqmaZnpl6qbHApauhZ52euKZ507KqqKZdnrmtusSsqmhrYGeGeHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fillness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fillness-and-health.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fillness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fillness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fillness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fillness-and-health.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ted-turner-parents-robert-edward-turner-ii-florence-turner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ted-turner-parents-robert-edward-turner-ii-florence-turner.html>Robert Edward Turner II, Florence Turner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rob-kardashian.html>Latest News &amp;amp; Pictures of Robert Jr.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rob-kardashian.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
