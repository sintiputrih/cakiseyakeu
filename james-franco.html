From starring in films with the likes of Seth Rogen and Julia Roberts to shying from the limelight, here's all you need to know about the actor.</p><h2>James Franco's childhood and first break</h2><p id=eKOWVU08IF data-wc=53>Born in California on April 19, 1978, his academic strengths led him to enroll at the University of California as an English major. However, having developed a taste for the stage performing in school plays he dropped out after his freshman year against his parents' wishes to pursue a career as an actor.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHo0vKixPa data-wc=68>His first break came in 1999 when he was cast as a leading role in the TV series . He was subsequently cast as the lead in Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biopic . This role was to place him firmly on the Hollywood map as it ensured him a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award.&nbsp;</p><h2>James Franco's career</h2><p id=edkW9GT37jV data-wc=74>The rising star cemented his popularity with the 2002 superhero film . Cast as Harry Osborn, the best friend of Peter Parker, the success of the film led to him reprising the role in the 2004 and 2007 sequels. James also worked hard in the two years between the two films, co-starring in the drama alongside Robert de Niro in 2002 and alongside Neve Campbell in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p id=evqh33JMSMW data-wc=85>In 2006 the actor received a Golden Globe nod for his performance as a stoner in . Although many believed he used method acting to perfect the role, James says that in reality he's very straightlaced: "I used to smoke weed, but I haven't done it in a long time. Everybody, even now, thinks, 'That guy is stoned.' It's just the way I talk, because I don't smoke weed. Somehow, there's something about me, the way I talk, that implies I'm on drugs."&nbsp;</p><p id=eZKxmj1iDla data-wc=93>As well as a Golden Globe nomination, James won the 2008 Independent Spirit Award for his role opposite Sean Penn in . His gripping portrayal of trapped mountain climber Aron Ralston in won the actor an Oscar nod in 2010, ensuring his star is firmly on the rise. He featured in with Julia Roberts in the same year.

In 2013 became a film starring himself and Emma Roberts.</p><h2>James Franco outside of acting</h2><p id=ecIFLJLCRVQ data-wc=113>Often interested in education, he moved to New York and enrolled at four graduate schools at the same time. In 2010 he started a PhD in English at Yale University. Director Judd Apatow said of the star: "He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading on set..." Speaking of his decision to go back to school, James said: "I was really tired of acting. I was putting a ton of work in and not getting as much satisfaction out of it. So I just needed something else to focus my attention on, to take the pressure off. Turns out that I love school."&nbsp;</p><p id=eEUQT2yRi6 data-wc=92>By 2017, James revealed that he was slowing down his career to focus on himself. In 2021 he paid more than $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit against him from two former students of his acting school when accused of sexual misconduct. The actor appeared on the Jess Cagle Podcast where he admitted to being in treatment for sexual addiction since 2016 and having sex with students, but he didn't address other allegations against him. That same year, frequent collaborator Seth Rogen expressed he doubted he would ever work with him again.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV%2BcnyQa2xycWNkt6K5xKxkn6qRo7Cwew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-franco.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-franco.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-franco.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-franco.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-franco.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-franco.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kelly-osbourne-calls-out-mom-sharon-revealing-baby-name.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kelly-osbourne-calls-out-mom-sharon-revealing-baby-name.html>Kelly Osbourne Calls Out Mom Sharon For Revealing Her Baby Name: Its No Ones Place</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./evander-holyfield.html>Evander Holyfield - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Career, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./evander-holyfield.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
