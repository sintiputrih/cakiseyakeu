It led to a hilarious exchange, and we have all the details below!</p><h2 id=39-friends-39-continues-to-be-an-iconic-sitcom>'Friends' Continues To Be An Iconic Sitcom</h2><p>In 1994, the landscape of television was forever altered when Friends made its debut on NBC. Though the network already had Seinfeld carrying the banner, Friends came along and turned into a juggernaut while simultaneously conquering its competition.</p><p>The series utilized a familiar blueprint that had worked previously, and it made the right changes to go from good to great in a flash. Thanks to this, as well as some spot-on casting decisions, the series developed into a classic over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>10 seasons and nearly 240 episodes later, Friends had etched a permanent place in history. Whether it's the hilarious quite, the memorable moments, or the things that didn't age well, most people have a memory from Friends, which is partly what has kept it so popular after all these years.</p><p>Each performer was brilliant as the respective character, but the argument could be made the Lisa Kudrow was the best casting choice overall.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Friends Co-Stars David Schwimmer And Jennifer Aniston Date In Real Life?</a></span></p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-thrived-as-phoebe-on-friends>Lisa Kudrow Thrived As Phoebe On Friends</h2><p>It's no surprise that Phoebe Buffay remains one of the show's best and most loved character to this very day. This is largely because Lisa Kudrow was fantastic as the character, bringing out the best of her in each episode of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Initially, Kudrow had a rough start to the show, and this stemmed from having to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reconnect with a director</a> that she previously worked with on Frasier.</p><p>"I had to do a special audition for Jim Burrows. You have to do auditions for producers and studio, network but in between all of that, I had to go in and read for Jim Burrows" Kudrow revealed.</p><p>Thankfully, she landed the role, and the rest is history.</p><p>During the production of Friends, Kudrow was pregnant and eventually gave birth to her son, Julian.</p><p>Kudrow once dished on how her son became part of the cast huddle.</p><p>"The six of us would do a huddle backstage and just say, 'All right, have a good show, love you, love you, love you, love you.' And when I was pregnant, then they would say, 'Have a great show, love you love you â€” love you, little Julian,'" she revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress recently revealed that Julian has sat down to watch Friends for the first time, and the pair shared a hilarious moment while talking about his first impressions of the classic sitcom.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>From This Perspective Friends Was Far Superior To Seinfeld</a></span></p><h2 id=her-son-39-s-reaction-to-watching-it-for-the-first-time>Her Son's Reaction To Watching It For The First Time</h2><p>So, what was Julian's reaction to checking out the show for the first time? According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Kudrow revealed that Julian enjoyed it.</p><p>"He called me up and said, 'So I just watched the first two episodes. It's really good, Mom.' I said, 'Thanks.' He said, 'Can I ask you some questions about that?' I'm like, 'Yes!' I almost started crying. I didn't think that anyone in my family liked that show," Kudrow said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress then noted that the series wrapped when her son was still just 5, and it took a long time before he was old enough to finally check out his mom's old show.</p><p>It was during this time that Kudrow revealed a hilarious moment that happened between the two of them.</p><p>"He said, 'It's actually really funny. I mean, the guys are so funny,'" Kudrow shared.</p><p>That's right, he left his mom out of the equation! He quickly realized what he had done, and immediately gave his mom her kudos.</p><p>"He's like, 'No, I mean you're funny too.' Never in my life have I wanted to tell my own kid, like, 'F--- you!' I mean, I thought it, I didn't say it," Kudrow continued.</p><p>This exchange must have been hilarious in the moment, as Kudrow probably wasn't expecting to be omitted from what Julian enjoyed about the show. It's a good thing that he realized what he had done so quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>From Season 3 To 6 On Friends The Lights Were On But Nobody Was Home For Matthew Perry</a></span></p><p>It'll be years from now, but hopefully, Kudrow's grandkids will give her props for Friends a touch sooner that her son did.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Which Sitcom Was More Expensive To Film, Seinfeld Or Friends?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoquRYri2sNGormarn6N6s7HAnKuip55iwbB51pqrnKCZo7RustGinKeco2KzsL6MrZ%2BeZZaev7TAjK2gpp1f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html>Sara Gilbert Bio, Wife, Children, Net Worth, Age, Siblings, Is She Dead, Gay?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kruzadar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-52071-html.html>Kruzadar Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kruzadar-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-52071-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
