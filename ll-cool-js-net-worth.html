Finally, the executives at Def Jam Recordings got their hands on his demo. Def Jam well received the demo, and his debut album was released.</p><p>His new stage name, LL Cool J, stood for Ladies Love Cool James, and the song was released under that moniker.</p><p>Cool J was well-liked by the rap business and the general public, as evidenced by his 1984 single “I Need a Beat,” selling over 100,000 copies. He dropped out of high school to make his first album as a result of this.</p><p>His debut album, “Radio,” was a major hit, selling over 1,500,000 copies. It was not only a commercial success, but it was also a critical hit, with Cool J introducing traditional song structure to rap, making it more accessible to the average listener.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/li-cool-j-profile-image-1024x683.jpeg><p>In 1987, he would follow it up with “Bigger and Deffer.” “I Need Love” was one of the earliest pop-rap songs to be released. With the record hitting 2X platinum, he was once again met with critical and commercial praise.</p><p>In 1989, he released a new album, Walking with a Panther, which again went platinum. The hip-hop scene in the United States began to emerge around this period.</p><p>The hip-hop community’s themes began to include more gangster overtones. “Mama Said Knock You Out” was released in 1990. The record had a tougher edge to it, which appealed to the hip-new hop generation… It was regarded as yet another triumph.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><p>So, let’s get to know Ll Cool J’s a little better, starting with some basic facts about him.</p><table class="table biofactstable"><tbody><tr><th>Full Name</th><td>James Todd Smith</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-adjust"></i>Known name</th><td>Ll Cool J</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>Jan 14, 1968</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></i>Birthplace</th><td>&nbsp;Bay Shore, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><th>Age</th><td>55 years old</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Religion</th><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Gender</th><td>Male</td></tr><tr><th>Mother</th><td>Ondrea Smith</td></tr><tr><th>Father</th><td>James Nunya</td></tr><tr><th>Siblings</th><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><th>Height</th><td>In meters – 1.91 m<br>In Feet and Inches – 6 ft 3 in</td></tr><tr><th>Weight</th><td>In Kilograms –&nbsp; 96 kg<br>In Pounds – 212 lbs</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td><strong>Eye color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>School</strong></td><td>Robert Moses Middle School</td></tr><tr><td><strong>College</strong></td><td>&nbsp;Northeastern University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Source of Wealth</strong></td><td>Professional Raps, TV shows</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active Years</strong></td><td>1984–present</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Rapper, Record Producer, Television producer, Actor, Entrepreneur</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Girlfriend</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Simone Smith&nbsp;(m. 1995)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Najee Laurent Todd Eugene Smith, Samaria Leah Wisdom Smith, Italia Anita Maria Smith, Nina Simone Smith</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ex-Spouse</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Yearly Salary</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$120 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Facebook</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>December, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Early Life: Ll Cool J</h2><p>Ondrea Griffith and James Louis Smith Jr. gave birth to LL Cool J on January 14th, 1968, in Bay Shore, New York. Unfortunately, LL Cool’s upbringing was marred by a series of tragic experiences.</p><p>LL was four years old when he discovered his mother and grandma shot and bloodied. Then, in a squabble over their divorce procedures in 1972, his father shot and nearly killed them.</p><p>His mother’s second engagement was with a heroin addict named Roscoe Granger, who regularly beat LL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ll-Cool-J-young.jpg><p>Smith became interested in music at a young age when he joined his church choir. He started rapping at the age of nine. At sixteen, his grandfather, a jazz musician, encouraged James’ music and purchased his first mixing table.</p><p>Sears provided the mixing table. His mother was a strong supporter of his work, and she used a tax rebate to buy him a Korg drum machine one year.</p><h2>Ll Cool J’s Net Worth and Income</h2><h3>Ll Cool J’s Net Worth</h3><p><strong>An<span class="jss404 jss426"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~8~1 class="jss406 jss428">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss429"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~9~0 class="jss406 jss430">American&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss431"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~10~0 class="jss406 jss432">hip-hop&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss433"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~11~0 class="jss406 jss434">artist&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss435"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~12~0 class="jss406 jss436">best&nbsp;</span><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~12~1 class="jss406 jss437">recognized&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss438"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~13~0 class="jss406 jss439">for&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss440"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~14~0 class="jss406 jss441">popularizing&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss442"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~15~0 class="jss406 jss443">the&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss404 jss444"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~16~0 class="jss406 jss445">genre worldwide</span></span><span class="jss404 jss449"><span id=editable-content-within-article~0~18~0 class="jss406 jss450">, Ll Cool J’s net worth is a staggering $120 million as of 2023.</span></span></strong></p><p>LL Cool J may only have had one album reach number one on the Billboard 200, G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All-Time) from 2000, but his albums have all gone platinum or double platinum.</p><p>Mr. Smith, released in 1995, is his best-selling album, with over 2.1 million copies sold, and the singles “Lounging” and “Hey Lover,” both from that album, are his highest-charting and best-selling songs as a lead artist.</p><p>But it was on Jennifer Lopez’s “All I Have,” which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, that he had his finest chart success of all time.</p><p>J began his career as a successful rapper and was regarded as such for a long time, but he is now more known as an actor and TV personality, and his remuneration reflects this.</p><p>He’s worked on NCIS: Los Angeles for more than 11 years, and his income has climbed to a whopping $350,000 per episode since he first started.</p><p>With 24 episodes in a season, J would be looking at an annual salary of $8.4 million for playing the special agent with a golden heart.</p><p>Though it isn’t disclosed how much he earns per episode of Lip Sync Battle, it is certain to be in the six figures, and with five seasons under his belt, J has amassed the majority of his wealth from the television.</p><h3>Ll Cool J’s Income</h3><p>His bread and butter are Los Angeles, and he’s well compensated for his role as Sam Hanna on the show. According to Bankrate, he earns $150,000 every episode, or $3.6 million for a 24-episode season.</p><p>If you can do the math, LL Cool J’s net worth is estimated to be roughly $36 million (10 seasons of NCIS: Los Angeles at $3.6 million per season).

LL Cool J’s mansion, which was built in 1993 and sat on just under three acres.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ll-cool-j-house-manhasset.jpg><p>With his wife, three daughters, and son, he lives in this Tudor-style home with six bathrooms, three fireplaces, a swimming pool, and 5,552 square feet. This mansion also has a hair salon for his kids’ hairstylists to come in and visit.</p><p>Manhasset is a town on Long Island’s North Shore with a population of about 8,300 people.</p><h4>Los Angeles House</h4><p>On April 24, 2013, the house where LL Cool J beat up a 56-year-old vagrant for breaking into his Studio City home on August 22, 2012, at around 1:30 a.m., was listed on the market for $5,950,000.</p><p>The house was constructed in 2004 and had 6 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms with a total square footage of 7,566 square feet on a 0.72-acre lot.</p><p>This home was recently purchased for $1,075,000 on August 16, 2002, and it appears to be a land acquisition with the home being built in 2004. This mansion is not owned by LL Cool J but by Juliette Industries LLC, a Sherman Oaks-based corporation.</p><p>To bear in mind about this location is that it is next to Harvard Westlake High School, which was recently in the headlines for a proposed parking expansion.</p><p>While it may not directly influence this home, some neighbors are against it, so keep that in mind when looking at it.</p><p>Because no interior photos were included in the ad, it appears that LL Cool J is currently renting this home. As a result, LL Cool J may be looking for a new property in the Los Angeles region.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>When LL Cool J initially became famous, he possessed around ten expensive cars. The musician rose to stardom as a rapper as a teenager in the 1980s, and he admits that when he initially made huge money, he lavished it on himself and his family.</p><p>He had 10 to 12 cars, including BMWs, Mercedes, and Porsches. He spent millions of dollars on these high-end automobiles. Luxury automobiles, on the other hand, are no longer on his list.</p><h4>Mercedes Benz</h4><p>The cheapest Mercedes-Benz sedan, the A-Class Limousine, costs Rs 41.19 lakh, while the most costly model, the AMG GT, costs Rs 2.64 crore.</p><p>Mercedes-Benz is a high-end luxury vehicle, so, unsurprisingly, it includes several features that you won’t find in a regular automobile. Even so, there are so many amenities that you may not be aware of all of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ll-Cool-J-car-mercedes-benz.jpg><p>Even the Mercedes-Benz SmartKey has a few tricks up its sleeve, so we’ll show you how to make the most of it. The top-of-the-line X-Class will be powered by a V6 engine, according to Daimler.</p><p>The engine is connected to a permanent all-wheel-drive system called 4MATIC. The pickup truck, according to Mercedes, has a payload capacity of more than 1.1 tons and a towing capacity of 3.5 tons.</p><h4>Porsche</h4><p>The starting price of the 2021 Porsche 911 is $99,200, making it one of the most costly vehicles in the already expensive luxury sports car class. The high-end 911 Turbo S cabriolet costs roughly $216,000 to buy.</p><p>For excellent savings at your local Porsche dealer, check out our U.S. News Best Price Program.</p><p>The Porsche 911 is a fantastic high-end sports car. The interior of the 911 is stunning, with high-end materials, plush front seats, and an easy-to-use touchscreen infotainment system. It also comes with the most up-to-date technology and security features.</p><p>However, one of 911’s greatest accomplishments is that it does not compromise everyday comfort for performance.</p><p>Thanks to its tight steering, balanced body control, and brawny turbocharged engine lineup, it’s fun to drive on twisty switchback roads, yet it still rides softly over bumpy pavement.</p><p>The 911’s main notable flaws are its high starting price, narrow rear seats, and limited trunk room. However, few vehicles in this class offer rear seats, and if you don’t plan on putting passengers in the back, the space can be used for extra cargo.</p><h4>BMW</h4><p>The 2020 BMW 3 Series sedan has a starting price of $40,750. That’s nearly $2,500 more than the median price of a fancy small car. Nevertheless, the BMW 3 Series is a fantastic vehicle. Engines that are dynamic and responsive are among the performance highlights.</p><p>Thanks to its well-balanced suspension system, this sports sedan is not only entertaining to drive, but it also won’t leave you feeling beat up after a long day on the road.</p><p>However, it has a few flaws since some rivals outperform the 3 Series in interior extravagances and infotainment use.</p><h4>470-hp Dodge Challenger SRT8</h4><p>The 2012 Challenger SRT8 392 ($43,995) comes with a 470-hp 6.4-liter Hemi V8 and a 6-speed manual or 5-speed automated transmission ($995). Street and Racing Technology is the abbreviation for “Street and Racing Technology.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ll-Cool-J-car-300x200.jpg><p>SRT formed as Team Viper to develop the Dodge Viper. SRT became synonymous with the entire Dodge lineup over time. When you see a new Dodge Challenger SRT8, you can be sure that it has a V8 engine.</p><p>The Dodge Challenger SRT 392 has a top speed of 182 mph and a 0-60 time of 4.2 seconds, 1.2 seconds faster than the Ford Mustang V6.</p><h3>Watch</h3><p>In NCIS: Los Angeles, LL Cool J wears a Suunto X-Lander Military special agent Sam Hanna.</p><p>The watch can be seen in the commercial image and the film Ambush, where Sam Hanna uses his watch to convey morse code via a laser beam reflection.</p><p>Suunto’s X-Lander watch is a true outdoor instrument with an altimeter, barometer, compass, and most conventional watch functions, all housed in a rugged metal shell.</p><p>LL Cool J’s X-Lander Military edition has a black aluminum case and a black rubber strap.
