The Webtoon has grown as famous as it was once in Korea, but at the moment, it has been translated into several other languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Thai, French, and even in English. Created by Park Tae-Jun, the Lookism series explores the societal beauty standards, bullying, and <a href=#>high school</a> experience. It follows the life of a young boy who gets bullied most of his life due to being obese. However, this changes when he gets the body that society deems attractive and gets treated better. The show’s first season is soon getting released on Netflix, and here is everything we know about the second season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lookism Season 2 Release Date: When will it premiere?</h2><p>We have yet to determine when the second season of the Lookism show will be available on Netflix. The show’s first season was initially slated for a November release, but it was rescheduled due to unavoidable circumstances. We are still determining whether the series will get renewed, but in case of a renewal, you should expect the show to be released by 2023 or 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lookism Season 2 Plot: What should we expect?</h2><p>The lookism series is an adaptation of a webtoon of the same name, and it follows Daniel Park, the undesirable obese teen who gets picked on by everyone in school. His number one bully Logan Lee makes his life a living hell, and when Daniel Park transfers to the Seoul school, he hopes his life will be bearable. One day however he wakes up as tall and attractive, different from what he is normally. He lives in two bodies and returns to his obese one at the night’s end. The series’ second season plot could expound further on Daniel’s experience as an attractive young man and how societal beauty standards are biased.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lookism Season 2 Cast: Who will be returning?</h2><p>Daniel Park plays Park Hyeong- Suk, the series protagonist, and he is described as one of the kindest cast on board. He gets mistreated for the longest time but has to lay low to ensure his safety and that of his mother. However, things turn around, and he starts standing up for himself. Other casts include Lee Eun Tae ho plays Vasco, Hong Jae Yeol as Jay Hong, Lee Jin Sung as Zack Lee, Kim Mi Jin as Mira Kim, Park Ha Neul as Zoe Park, and Choi Soo Jung as Crystal Choi. If the Lookism show is renewed for the second season, then you should expect all of the series cast to reprise their roles. We might also get to see new faces in the second season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lookism Season 2 Trailer: When will it be out?</h2><p>Unfortunately, a trailer for the lookism series is nonexistent and will not come out soon. The show was scheduled to debut on 4th November, but it was later postponed, and at the moment, we are still determining how soon the series will be renewed and if it will ever get renewed. We will have to wait a while before we are sure we will be getting to see Park Hyeong-Seok for the second season. If the series gets renewed, the trailer will be available for streaming in 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57y6impKGjonq0scCspqdlopq5pq3SnmSdmaSaeqSt0q1kqaSfqXqxvsSdoJysmaS7tHnTq5iipJWnfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flookism-season-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flookism-season-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flookism-season-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flookism-season-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flookism-season-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flookism-season-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-the-mysterious-person-saving-the-day-in-loki-season-2-episode-1s-ending.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-the-mysterious-person-saving-the-day-in-loki-season-2-episode-1s-ending.html>Who is the mysterious person saving the day in Loki season 2, episode 1s ending?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kurt-kaiser-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html>Kurt Kaisers biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kurt-kaiser-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
