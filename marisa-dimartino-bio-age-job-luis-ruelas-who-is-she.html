<time>13 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>As per the article published by Page Six dated May 24, 2022, we have come to know that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice’s fiance, Luis Ruelas, allegedly pushed his ex-wife, Marisa DiMartino, into a metal pole during a heated argument in 2012.</p><p>Find out about that and many other allegations made against Luis Ruelas in the wiki article below. Also, find out about Marisa DiMartino’s age, job, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Marisa DiMartino, Luis Ruelas Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p>According to a police report obtained by Page Six, Marisa and Luis began to argue over the finances after her divorced husband dropped off the children. The argument quickly turned into something serious after Teresa Giudice’s fiancee pushed Marisa into a metal support pole in the garage.</p><p>This incident took place in the presence of the couple’s son. Since Marisa refused medical attention and declined to press charges against Luis, no arrest was made.</p><p>Two years prior to that incident, on New Year’s Eve 2010, Marisa had filed a separate police report claiming she and Luis had a verbal dispute which forced her to leave her family home. That time too, Marisa had declined to press any charges, so no arrest was made.</p><p>A year after their verbal dispute, the two officially divorced. Clearly, there was no improvement in their relationship when they transitioned from being spouses to co-parents as Marisa claimed that Luis “shouted names” at her in the presence of their kids during a custody exchange on June 6, 2016.</p><p>She even filed a police report after the incident and according to the report, Luis had come to pick up their son at approx 6 and wanted to exchange some words. Since she did not want to come to the door, he continued ringing and banging on the door till she opened it, scaring their other son, upstairs.</p><p>“At drop off, he shouted names in front of both children as he sped off with the second son who he claims wants to live with him,” Marisa said.</p><p>Police did not make an arrest as no one pressed any charges in relation to the alleged incident.</p><h3><strong>Marisa DiMartino Relationship Status Today</strong></h3><p>Talking about Marisa’s relationship status today, we, unfortunately, don’t know if she stayed single or saw someone after her split from her former husband Luis Ruelas.</p><p>As of this writing, Marisa has nothing but good things to say about her ex-husband’s relationship with the RHONJ star, Teresa Giudice. After dating for just over a year, Luis proposed to Teresa in October 2021 during their romantic vacation in Greece.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Marisa-DiMartino1-300x293.jpg><p>“I’m really happy for Teresa and Luis. I’m happy for him. Luis is actually the father of my children, and he’s a really good person. In general, we got married, we were very young and had babies and then it fell apart… We’re very good with each other, and that’s basically it,” Marisa told In Touch. On Luis and Teresa’s compatibility, Marisa refused to comment saying she’s “not concerned.”</p><p>While Marisa’s ex and Teresa look happy together, many people are worried their relationship might not survive for long pointing at his shady past.</p><p>Before Luis began dating Teresa, he was in a relationship with his fiancee Vanessa Reiser, who he dated from 2018 to 2020. Vanessa had filed a lawsuit against him accusing him of being very demanding sexually and punishing her if she could not satisfy him.</p><p>Luis’s former partner Paula Sanchez, who he dated from 2011 to 2018, also made similar claims about him.</p><h3><strong>Marisa DiMartino Kids</strong></h3><p>Marisa has two kids, namely Louie Jr. (18 years old as of 2022) and Nicholas (20 years old as of 2022), with her ex-husband Luis Ruelas.
