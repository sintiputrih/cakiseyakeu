"One minute I felt okay,” Bill Paxton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> Entertainment Weekly. "The next minute I felt so goddamn anxious I wanted to breathe in a paper bag."<p>The movie was plagued by injuries as well: Kate Winslet caught pneumonia after refusing to wear a wetsuit under her costume, and almost drowned after her coat got caught on a gate and pulled her underwater.

I finally went to the doctor, thinking he was going to clean out my knee and give me some antibiotics, but it turned out I had a staph infection that was close to giving me blood poisoning.

The filmmakers knew about the tests, but the government assured them that radiation posed no threat to the crew and actors. By 1980, 91 people out of a crew of 220 were diagnosed with cancer; director Dick Powell and John Wayne both died of the disease.

Hoping to warm him up, a crew member boiled water to pour down Tatum's wetsuit, but he made a fatal error: He forgot to dilute the boiling water with cold water from the river.<p>"So he poured scalding water down my suit. And I was trying to pull the suit away from my body to somehow get away from the boiling water, and the more I pulled the suit away, the lower the water went," Tatum <a href=#>recounted</a> to Details. The water scalded Tatum, even burning a patch of skin on his penis.</p></span><span class=credit>Focus Features</span><p>Next, check out 80 <a href=#>textless movie posters</a> that'll dazzle you without a single word.
