Disgraced actor Danny Masterson was accused of three charges of rape in June 2020. He was arrested on June 17, 2020, on charges of violently raping three women between 2001 and 2003. After posting a $3.3 million bond, the actor was eventually freed.</p><p>Opening arguments in the sexual assault trial were heard on October 18, 2022. On May 31, 2023, a decision was made, which was nearly seven months later. Of the three rape counts, he was found guilty on two of them. He received a 30-year prison term in September 2023.</p><p>Before the full name of Niesha was revealed, she was referred to as N.T.</p><p>According to DailyMail, Neisha told the court in May 2021 that he “ravaged” her “like a rag doll.” Unfolding the traumatic accounts from 2003, Neisha revealed that she and her friends went out for drinks with Masterson at a Hollywood bar. They were acquainted before but Danny, “started staring at me in a very predatory way. He was staring at me very aggressively. He wouldn’t take his eyes off me.”</p><p>Neisha felt “flattered and intimidated” but gave him her phone number.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A couple of days later, he texted her, she said, ‘in the form of a command, ordering me to come over to his home now, immediately, to bring my bathing suit and to get in my pool. “I didn’t understand why he was being so aggressive. It was bizarre. I thought maybe this was his way of flirting.”</p><p>After having a drink to calm her nerves she went to Masterson’s house where “he immediately handed me a glass of red wine. When I arrived, my expectations were maybe to flirt a little….have a glass of wine…maybe something in the realm of romance but nothing serious.”</p><p>Danny then led her to his jacuzzi area where “He commanded me to go in the jacuzzi.” ‘He said, “Take off your clothes right now….take them off…take them off. If you don’t, I’m going to do it. I’m going to strip you right now.”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Neisha – who said that she started to feel ‘blurry’ – went on “I was scared so I didn’t try to be argumentative. But I told him no, I didn’t want to take my clothes off. I was trying to obey him so some of my clothes came off…I still had underwear and a camisole on I think.…. I got in the jacuzzi and we were kissing, making out. But I was out of it at that point.”</p><p>She described him as being a drill sergeant and she kept obeying him. Eventually, he crossed the line and <a href=#>rap*d her</a>.</p><p>According to Variety, the actor was found guilty on two counts of forced rape on May 31, 2023. According to the source, “the jury could not reach a verdict on a third rape charge, deadlocking with a vote of 8-4 in favor of conviction.” Masterson was brought into custody until his court date and handcuffed right away.</p><p>“I am experiencing a complex array of emotions — relief, exhaustion, strength, sadness — knowing that my abuser, Danny Masterson, will face accountability for his criminal behavior,” said Niesha in a statement about Masterson’s guilty verdict (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>).</p><p>Masterson was given a 30-year prison term in 2023 after being found guilty of two charges of rape. “Mr. Masterson, you are not the victim here,” the judge said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AP News reported</a>. “Your actions 20 years ago took away another person’s choice and voice. Your actions 20 years ago today were criminal, and that’s why you are here.”</p><p>“When you raped me, you stole from me,” said Neisha in an impact statement to the judge at the sentencing. “That’s what rape is, a theft of the spirit.”</p><p>Her attorney Allison Anderson told Variety, “Niesha and Chrissie have displayed tremendous strength and bravery, by coming forward to law enforcement and participating directly in two grueling criminal trials. Despite persistent harassment, obstruction, and intimidation, these courageous women helped hold a ruthless sexual predator accountable today, and they are not stopping there. They are eager to soon tell the fuller story of how Scientology and its enablers tried desperately to keep them from coming forward.”</p><p>In June 2023, Neisha shared <a href=#>on IG</a> that she was thankful for Voices In Action in a lengthy post for their support throughout the process.</p><p>Five years later, Neisha ran into Danny at an event and she said hi. “He was staring at me with kind of a death stare. He looked like he wanted to kill me.”</p><h3><strong>Niesha Trout Husband</strong></h3><p>Niesha Trout was married to her late husband Mark Trout. In <a href=#>August 2023</a>, she posted snapshots of a poem Mark wrote on her Twitter account. On her X account, she has shared that people should get married only after the age of 40. Commenting on dating shows like Bachelor and Bachelorette, she added that 24 is just a tall toddler.</p><p>Niesha has also posted her thoughts on the dating app. In June 2021, she joked about, “Deleting my dating apps and finding someone the old-fashioned way—by tying myself to train tracks and finally letting Chris Evans rescue me.” In April 2018, she tweeted, “There should be a dating app for people who are chronically having an existential crisis.”</p><p>Niesha shared about her past dating life as she tweeted in August 2018, “I once had a boyfriend who was a tiny drunkard and he would fall down at bars and parties and I would have to help carry him out of places. He fell out of bed sometimes too. It was like having a two-legged dog.”</p><h3><strong>Is Niesha Trout On Instagram And Facebook?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Niesha Trout is on Instagram (<a href=#>@niesha_trout</a>), Twitter (<a href=#>@nieshatrout</a>), and Facebook (<a href=#>@niesha.trout</a>).</p><h3><strong>Niesha Trout Age</strong></h3><p>Born before 1982, Niesha Trout is at least 41 years old as of Sept 2023.</p><h3><strong>Niesha Trout Job</strong></h3><p>Niesha Trout has described herself as an artist, poet, and writer.
