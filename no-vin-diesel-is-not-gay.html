I come from the Harrison Ford, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino code of silence. I’m not gonna do that.”</strong></p><p>In 2019, Slate culture writer Jeffrey Bloomer published a column titled “The Fast and Furious Movies Have Always Been Gay,” which once again sparked discussion among fans about Vin Diesel’s sexuality.</p><p>According to Bloomer, Diesel’s comment about dating abroad<strong> “a possibly unintended dog whistle to every gay boy whose middle school girlfriend went to a different school.”</strong></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sportskeeda.com</a>, Diesel has denied the rumors of him being gay and called them untrue.</p><h2>Who Is Vin Diesel Married Too?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vin-diesel-and-Paloma-Jimenez.webp><p>Vin Diesel, although not married, is in a committed relationship with his girlfriend, Paloma Jimenez.
