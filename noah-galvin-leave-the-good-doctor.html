The fan-favorite character (played by Noah Galvin) was killed off in the most devastating way during the sixth episode of Season 7. So, <a href=# rel=noopener>why did Noah Galvin leave The Good Doctor</a>? We have all the details below.</p><p>ABC’s&nbsp;<a href=#>The Good Doctor</a> is a medical drama following Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young, autistic surgical resident at the fictional San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. Despite skepticism from his colleagues, Shaun use his extraordinary gifts and unique talents to save lives, eventually rising to the attending level. The series first premiered in 2017 and is currently on its seventh and final season.</p><p>Noah Galvin joined the cast of The Good Doctor during Season 4 as one of six new first-year residents. He starred as Dr. Asher Wolke, an atheist with a God complex who left the Hasidic community at age 18. Galvin was promoted to a series regular in Season 5 along with Bria Samoné Henderson, who stars as fellow resident Dr. Jordan Allen. That same season, Asher began dating St. Bonaventure nurse Jerome Martel (played by recurring guest star Giacomo Baessato) and their relationship quickly became a favorite amongst fans.</p><p>Their romance was short-lived, however, as Asher was tragically killed off before they could get their happy ending.

Although we don’t know for sure, Noah Galvin’s character was likely killed off for creative reasons. The show will eventually say goodbye to all of its character since it’s the final season, but no one was prepared for Dr. Asher Wolke’s story to end how it did.</p><p>The Good Doctor writer Adam Scott Weissman also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Wrap</a> at the time that Asher was killed off to highlight the rise of antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ+ attacks in the United States. “We came into this [episode] with the thought that life doesn’t always have happy endings. Sometimes things happen suddenly and in a tragic way,” Weissman said of the episode, which he described as “what we thought was a satisfying ending” for Asher. He continued, “Oftentimes [these issues] become real when it happens to someone you know, or someone we love on TV, so this horrible thing happens that also brings it home for our viewers.”</p><p>Weissman also explained how Galvin’s final episode was a full-circle moment for Asher when it came to his identity. “Asher’s final line when he says, ‘I’m not just a Jew, I’m a gay one, too.’ Those were two identities that prior to that he hadn’t been able to reconcile. He felt like he had to choose, which is what he is sort of going through in this episode,” Weissman said. “Him being able to come to that conclusion that I can be both of these two things was super important to us.”</p><p>He added that the writer’s room was “conscious” about The Good Doctor falling into the “bury your gays” trope of killing off queer characters for tragic storylines, however, he commended showrunner Liz Friedman for making Asher’s death meaningful for the series. “It’s a sad note, but it’s also a high note in that it’s a heroic moment for him where he embraces all sides of his identity, and does it to protect someone else and to protect the sacred space,” Weissman said.</p><p>Throughout Asher’s last episode, the third-year resident was attempting to reconnect with his Judaism. After participating in a patient’s wedding, Asher offered to drive the Rabbi back to his synagogue, which was in the process of being vandalized. He confronted the vandals, telling them: “I am a Jew. A gay one, in fact, and I’m calling the cops.” The vandals appeared to leave but as Asher walked away, they snuck up on him and delivered a fatal blow to the head. Meanwhile, Jerome sat at a nearby restaurant with a ring in his hand, waiting to propose — cue the tears.</p><p>While fans were still reeling from his death, Galvin took to Instagram to reflect on his time on the show. “I spent the last four years in Vancouver working away from my fiancee and dog and family. It was hard but these people made it really worth it,” he wrote alongside a series of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">behind-the-scenes photos and videos</a> featuring his castmates. “I love you @thegooddoctorabc thank you for everything!!” he added.</p><p>Several of Galvin’s co-stars commented on the post, sharing how much they’re going to miss him. “You make everything better I love you so much Noahy you are so loved,” Paige Spara, who stars as Shaun’s wife Lea, wrote. Kayla Cromer, who<a href=# rel=noopener> joined the cast this season</a> as Charlie Lukaitis, chimed in: “I’m so glad that I had an opportunity to meet you and work with you! Your amazing!”</p><p>Fans also commented on the post and expressed their sadness over Asher’s death. “You’re character deserved a better ending 😭😭😭,” one fan wrote. Another commented: “Can’t believe they killed you off like that. Just as your character was about to find happiness. He was embracing Judaism again. was probably about to get married, and then he was just offed.”</p><p>Galvin’s last episode ended with a message to fans that read: “If you or anyone you know has experienced antisemitism, racism, anti-LGBTQ+ related incidents or hate crimes, or if you want to learn more about what you can do to stop hate, please visit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>splcenter.org</a>.”</p><p>The Good Doctor Season 7 airs on ABC on Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.</p><p><b>See why other cast members <a href=# rel=noopener>have exited The Good Doctor</a>&nbsp;in the gallery below.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmmAdH%2BOp6aaoF2crq3CyKdkpZ2Rq7JuwMeeZKCnn5l6pbvCraarZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnoah-galvin-leave-the-good-doctor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnoah-galvin-leave-the-good-doctor.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnoah-galvin-leave-the-good-doctor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnoah-galvin-leave-the-good-doctor.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnoah-galvin-leave-the-good-doctor.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnoah-galvin-leave-the-good-doctor.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amd-quietly-launches-ryzen-7-8700f-and-ryzen-5-8400f-processors.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amd-quietly-launches-ryzen-7-8700f-and-ryzen-5-8400f-processors.html>AMD Quietly Launches Ryzen 7 8700F and Ryzen 5 8400F Processors</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./simon-lanes-girlfriend-list.html>Who is Simon Lane Dating Simon Lane's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./simon-lanes-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
