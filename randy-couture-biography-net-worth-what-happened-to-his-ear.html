no stranger to those involved in combat sports anyway.&nbsp;It is a product of repeated blows, knocks and crushing resulting in the rupture of blood vessels in the ear and subsequent hematoma leading to the collection of blood under the perichondrium (connective tissue surrounding the cartilage of the ear).&nbsp;It can be very painful and needs to be drained otherwise it hardens and stays deformed.&nbsp;To prevent cauliflower ear from forming, one can wear a helmet as this can avoid the complications that arise from the condition.</span></p><p><span>Complications include hearing loss, difficulty sleeping, headache, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), blurred vision, cosmetic deformity, general ear pain.</span></p><p><span>For treatment, an incision is made in the ear through which accumulated blood or fluid is drained.&nbsp;Also, the application of a pressure dressing to sandwich both sides of the skin against the cartilage is necessary.&nbsp;Antibiotics are also recommended to prevent infection.</span></p><p class=postsid
