<time>12 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>American actress Sara Gilbert made a number of appearances in television movies before she landed her breakthrough role at the age of 13 as Darlene Conner on the sitcom <i>Roseanne&nbsp;</i>which aired on ABC from 1988–1997. She is also known for a recurring role on CBS’s <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>.&nbsp;In addition to acting, Sara Gilbert is also a co-host and creator of the&nbsp;CBS&nbsp;daytime talk show&nbsp;<i>The Talk </i>which launched in 2010. In 2016, she won a&nbsp;Daytime Emmy for&nbsp;Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show as producer and creator of the TV show. However, she announced on the 9th of April 2019 that she would be leaving the show at the end of this season to focus on her career as an actress and producer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sara-gilbert-bio-age></span><strong>Sara Gilbert Bio (Age)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born as Sara Rebecca Abeles on January 29, 1975, in Santa Monica, California, the actress is the daughter of Barbara Cowan (née Crane) and Harold Abeles, both Jewish. Her parents got divorced when she was very young and in 1984, Sara decided to take the last name Gilbert from her mother’s first husband, actor Paul Gilbert.</p><p>Sara Gilbert studied at Yale University from where she graduated with honors in 1997, majoring in art with more emphasis on photography.&nbsp;Sequel to her appearances in TV movies and a&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;for&nbsp;Kool-Aid, the then 13-year-old Sara Gilbert was cast in the role of Darlene Conner in <i>Roseanne</i> and she remained a member of the show’s cast all through the nine years it ran on CBS, from 1988–97, appearing in 190 episodes. Consequently, she was given a chance to write a fourth-season episode story titled “Don’t Make Me Over”.</p><p>Her contribution to the show which earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations was of so much value that the producers had to juggle storylines and taping schedules just to give her room to carry on with her studies at Yale University and still be a part of the cast.</p><p>In 1990 and 1997 respectively, Sara appeared on the television movies Sudie and Simpson as Sudie Harrigan and on Broken Record, bagging the Young Artist Award for Best Young Actress in a Cable Special for her role in the former. She has also made appearances on The Simpsons, ABC Afterschool Special, Welcome to New York, Rugrats (voice), 24, Will & Grace, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, <i>Private Practice, </i>and Strong Medicine.</p><p>From 2004–2007, she appeared in 15 episodes of the hospital drama <i>ER,&nbsp;</i>portraying the character of Jane Figle, a smart and sarcastic medical student. Meanwhile, in 2005, she featured in The WB sitcom Twins, which was scrapped the following year after the WB and&nbsp;UPN networks merged to form The CW and canceled some shows. Sara Gilbert also had a recurring role as Fern Velch on the CBS sitcom&nbsp;<i>The Class.</i></p><p>From 2007 to 2010, Sara Gilbert appeared as Leslie Winkle in episodes of the television series <i>The Big Bang Theory.&nbsp;</i>In episode two of the show’s second season, she became the show’s main cast but in 2009, her character was moved from regular to recurring after it was announced in January that writers were at a loss on how to write for her character full-time. Subsequently, Amy Farrah Fowler&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bernadette Rostenkowski became prominent characters and as a result, Sara’s character was discontinued.</p><p>In 2018, an eight-episode&nbsp;revival series of&nbsp;<i>Roseanne </i>executive-produced by Sara Gilbert began airing on&nbsp;ABC, on March 27, 2018, and because it received positive reviews, a second season was announced. Unfortunately, ABC had to cancel the show after one season as a result of a controversial comment made by Barr on Twitter concerning former president Barack Obama’s advisor, Valerie Jarrett.</p><p>Having had a change of mind, ABC announced on June 21, 2018, that the network had&nbsp;ordered a spin-off of&nbsp;<i>Roseanne&nbsp;</i>which will include all the regular cast apart from Barr. The series captioned <i>The Conners </i>debuted in October 2018 starring Sara Gilbert, who is also the executive producer.</p><p>Apart from television, Sara has also appeared in a handful of films, including <i>Poison Ivy (</i>1992),&nbsp;<i>Light It Up</i> (1999), <i>Riding In Cars With Boys</i> (2001) among others.</p><p>Following her decision to leave the CBS daytime talk show, <i>The Talk, </i>in order to pay more attention to her career in the movie industry, we are sure to see more of Sara Gilbert’s best.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sara Gilbert has made millions of dollars from her job as an actress and producer. From the time she landed her breakthrough role in <i>Roseanne&nbsp;</i>at the age of 13, her relevance in the industry has been on the rise. It is, therefore, no surprise that she has a net worth of about $35 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=siblings></span><strong style=letter-spacing:-.02em>Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The TV producer has four older half-siblings- Melissa and Jonathan Gilbert from her mother’s side and Patrice and Joseph from her father’s side. Melissa is an actress and television director while Jonathan is a film/television actor and a stockbroker.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-she-gay-wife-and-children></span><strong style=letter-spacing:-.02em>Is She Gay? Wife and Children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When she was in her teenage years, Sara dated her <i>Roseanne/The Big Bang Theory </i>co-star Johnny Galecki. However, their relationship made her realize the fact that she was a lesbian so they broke up but still remained friends.</p><p>She later got involved with TV producer Allison Adler and together they have two kids – a son named Levi Hank, born to Adler in October 2004 and a daughter, Sawyer Jane, born to Sara Gilbert in August 2007.</p><p>Sara chose to keep her sexuality private for many years but as she was about to launch her talk show, <i>The Talk</i>, in 2010, she came out openly as a lesbian. The following year, she shared the news of her amicable separation from Adler.</p><p>Afterward, the actress started dating Linda Perry, an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. Sara announced their engagement in April 2013 and on the 30th of March 2014, they got married. On February 28, 2015, Sara Gilbert gave birth to their son, Rhodes Emilio Gilbert Perry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-sara-gilbert-dead></span><strong>Is Sara Gilbert Dead?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sometime in May 2019, news of Sara Gilbert’s death circulated, much to the sadness of her fans across the world. However, the news which gained traction after a ‘R.I.P. Sara Gilbert’ Facebook page garnered almost a million likes was officially confirmed by Sara’s representatives to be nothing but a hoax.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuRp65us8ilmZ6qpGKvqruMsKCfnV2Ytaq4w6ucp2WemsFuw86rq6FlkZyybr%2FIm6Oippeoeqq%2FjKyfnmWUmq6lecaasGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsara-gilbert-bio-wife-children-net-worth-age-siblings-is-she-dead-gay.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shellos-pok-c3-a9mon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shellos-pok-c3-a9mon.html>Shellos (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html>Lisa Kudrow's Son Had A Hilarious Reaction To Watching Friends For The First Time</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lisa-kudrow-son-reaction-to-watching-friends-for-the-first-time.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
