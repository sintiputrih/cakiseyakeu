However, when it comes to praise, Colbert doesn't think of many artists in a higher regard than <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we're going to look back at a specific encounter that changed the way Colbert viewed Swift. It all took place after a brief exchange between his daughter and the singer. Colbert was left speechless by the experience, and had nothing but praise for Taylor.</p><p>In addition, we'll take a look at the song Hey Stephen, and reveal if it truly was a tribute towards Stephen Colbert himself. Finally, we'll detail another touching moment that showed Swift taking time away, and doing yet another kind gesture for a celeb's daughter. In this instance, Swift went out of her way to write a note just prior to her performance.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Stephen Colbert Couldn't Keep A Straight Face After Sandra Bullock Revealed The Only Autograph She Ever Asked For</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-thought-taylor-swift-39-s-song-hey-stephen-was-about-stephen-colbert>Fans Thought Taylor Swift's Song Hey Stephen Was About Stephen Colbert</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52180554.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were very disappointed after Swift made the reveal that Hey Stephen was not about Stephen Colbert. The moment was viewed as a letdown, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift spoke about origins related to the song</a>, and how it all came about early on in her career.</p><p>“No, Stephen, I first recorded that song in 2008. I think I was like 18. And you were 44 years old."</p><p>“‘Hey Stephen’ is not about you any more than my album 1989 is about that year you spent waiting tables on the lunch shift at Scoozi, an Italian restaurant in the River North area of Chicago. That, by the way, serves a really incredible slice of pizza.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift Was Clearly Uncomfortable When Jimmy Fallon Went Off-Script And Showed Footage She Wasn't Expecting</a></span></p><p>Swift would go on to reveal that real origins of the song had to do with a prior crush. “Actually about a guy who I had a crush on and never told him.

That was especially true after her interaction with his daughter.

Colbert admitted that the moment was better than anything he could've imagined. His daughter wanted to meet Swift and was nervous about it - ultimately, Taylor handled it all with complete class.</p><p>Colbert recalls the experience, “I’ll love Taylor Swift ’til the day I die,” he began. “I would put on armor and follow her into battle.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She turns around and goes, ‘Pretty girl!’ and comes and puts her arms around her and goes, ‘Oh you look amazing!'” he recalled. “She just praises my daughter for how she looks for, like, 30 seconds. I would jump off a cliff into a pit of spikes for that woman for how nice she was to my daughter,” he added. “You’ve got to remember that!”</p><p>The great moment is revealed by Colbert in the video below.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Completely Disagree With A 'Rule' Taylor Swift Enforces On Her Closest Celeb Friends</a></span></p><p>It was another great moment showing Taylor Swift's kindness towards her fans, and taking a bit of time to acknowledge others.

It was a handwritten letter on a particular stationary," Harbour said. "I've never seen my stepdaughter speechless. She did say in the letter at one point, 'I'll give you a wave from the stage.' And at one point during the beginning of one of her numbers she turned to our little booth and [waved]."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a great moment for Harbour and the family, while he also revealed that Swift's performance on the night was truly remarkable as well.</p><p>He tells ET, "I really didn't have any idea," he admitted. "... Seeing her perform for three and a half hours [was impressive]. It's like 45 songs! I've never seen anything [like it]. She barely leaves the stage. I don't know when she pees. It's ridiculous."</p><p>Another new Taylor Swift fan added to the bunch!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZ2gnbKvecKoo5udoql6qr%2BMn6arnaaav26tjK2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2aekaN6p7vLpaawoZ6ceqmx0Wagp6yVp66kwMiopWavmam1brTIrGSdmaWctbWx0Wg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-her-interaction-with-his-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-her-interaction-with-his-daughter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-her-interaction-with-his-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-her-interaction-with-his-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-her-interaction-with-his-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-her-interaction-with-his-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-last-of-us-part-1-best-skill-upgrades.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-last-of-us-part-1-best-skill-upgrades.html>The Last of Us Part 1: best skill upgrades</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mika-hakkinen-age-height-parents-wife-children.html>Mika Hkkinen Age, Height, Parents, Wife, Children</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mika-hakkinen-age-height-parents-wife-children.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
