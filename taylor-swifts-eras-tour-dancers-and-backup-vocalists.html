I just love that that’s who she is!”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a full guide to Swift’s Eras Tour backup dancers and vocalists:</p><h3>Kameron Saunders</h3><p>The University of Missouri-Kansas City graduate has gone viral online for his performance during “Bejeweled.” Prior to his time with Swift, Saunders has toured with several prominent dance companies including Dallas Black Dance Theatre, Saint Louis Ballet and Missouri Contemporary Ballet.
