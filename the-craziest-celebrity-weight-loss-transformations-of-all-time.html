Adele’s celebrity friends <a href=#>went crazy for her new look</a>, which she reportedly maintains with <a href=#>the Sirtfood diet</a> and help from a personal trainer. Her weight loss came on the heels of her <a href=#>divorce from Simon Konecki in September 2019</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jessica Simpson</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image aligncenter">Jessica Simpson in October of 2018 (left) and in September of 2019 <span class=credit>Getty Images ; Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> had a massive mommy makeover after giving birth to daughter Birdie May.

The “Modern Family” star later revealed that her dramatic weight loss occurred <a href=#>after she switched antidepressants.</a> “For years I had been on antidepressants that caused me to gain weight that I couldn’t lose no matter what I did,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. “It was always frustrating for me because I wanted to be able to get fit and feel like the work I was doing was paying off, but it never felt that way. I had accepted it and moved on.” Since coming clean, the 22-year-old actress has continued to show off her waist <a href=#>in sexy Instagram posts</a>.

Nearly a year later, the 40-year-old reality star’s body hit a plateau and she couldn’t lose any more weight, so she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">underwent gastric sleeve and skin removal surgeries.</a> She <a href=#>stayed incognito</a> to hide her transformation from the public and <a href=#>debuted her new look</a> in March 2017.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jonah Hill</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image aligncenter">Jonah Hill in 2015 (L) and in 2017 <span class=credit>Pacific Coast News</span></figure><p><a href=#>Jonah Hill</a> decided to slim down and shocked fans when he appeared noticeably thinner <a href=#>in July 2016</a>.

For me it was about first realizing that I didn’t want to be the person I was anymore. Then the weight loss just came as a plus afterwards.” A year later, she <a href=#>flaunted her new figure</a> in a bikini while vacationing in Australia.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Khloé Kardashian</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image aligncenter">Khloe Kardashian in 2008 (L) and in 2019 <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a> changed her entire lifestyle and in doing so managed to lose weight and gain confidence.

The star admitted that she used to deprive herself when she tried to lose weight but learned from Weight Watchers that it was all about moderation. “I didn’t eat pasta, fried food, red meat.
