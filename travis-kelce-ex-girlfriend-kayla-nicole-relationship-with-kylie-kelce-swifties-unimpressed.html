"Winnie girl. What a sweet life she lived," she wrote, followed by a heart emoji.

Swift doesn't mean Kayla didn't know Kylie; people are so immature," one commenter wrote. Another weighed in on the backlash, writing, "You people really gotta stop hating on women YOU don't know on the internet. It's so stupid. Go on with your life, and DO not worry about people you will never KNOW."</p><p><strong>Other Instagram users defended Nicole's decision to comment on the post.</strong> "She should be allowed to comment on whatever she wants," one commenter wrote in response to the criticism of Nicole. "There's no need to be embarrassed for her; you should be embarrassed for yourself first with your comment. It shows your lack of maturity and development in logic." Another fan shared similar views on the topic, telling critics, "You literally don't know her or her intentions. She's commenting on someone's loss. She's allowed to send condolences. The fact that TS hasn't ... speaks volumes to the type of person she is," they wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-travis-kelce-and-kayla-nicole-date>When Did Travis Kelce And Kayla Nicole Date?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-and-kayla-nicole-1.jpg><p><strong>Nicole and Travis started dating in 2017.</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Their relationship lasted five years</a>, but they initially broke up in August 2020 and later got back together in November of that same year.
