Keep reading to see <a href=# rel=noopener>what happened to Coach Montes on All American</a> and how the show honored the late actor.</p><h2>What happened to Coach Montes on All American?</h2><p>Kamar de los Reyes — best known for starring as Antonio Vega on ABC’s One Life to Live — joined the cast of the CW drama in Season 6 as Coach Montes, the head coach for the Coastal California Manta Rays and the wife of Beverly Eagles head coach Elena Montes. The Puerto Rican actor died at age 56 on Dec. 24, 2023, following a brief battle with cancer. Before his death, de los Reyes was able to film the Season 6 premiere of All American, but his character has been inexplicably absent throughout the rest of the season.</p><p>The show finally closed Coach Montes’ storyline and paid tribute to the late actor during the milestone 100th episode, titled “Mass Appeal.” Although Montes did not appear on-screen at any point during the episode, viewers learned that he planned to leave Coastal California to take a job with the NFL. Asher Adams (played by Cody Christian), who worked for the coach and had a very close relationship with him, avoided Montes for the majority of the episode, not wanting to say goodbye. When he received a gift from Montes by way of his wife, Asher finally worked up the courage to call his mentor and boss and say a proper goodbye. The episode also included a “in loving memory” tribute card to de los Reyes.</p><p>After the episode, Christian opened up about his real-life relationship with de los Reyes, which mirrors that of their characters. “I did have a very unique relationship with that man outside of the show,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>TVLine</a>. “Just in those two-and-a-half years, I went through hell and back in my own life. Kamar was acting as a real-life coach for me many, many, many times. We would shoot all day and then spend a couple hours after shooting, just talking and catching up on life. I relied on him a lot.”</p><p>Christian was one of the only series regulars that shared scenes with de los Reyes, and he commended the late actor for filming Season 6 while battling cancer. “Just to have the opportunity to go in and work with him within those circumstances, to give him the respect and flowers he deserved, was a moment I’ll never forget,” he said. “I’m not even going to lie to you: Those first two episodes [of Season 6], it was difficult for me to watch it, simply because he’s an incredible man.”</p><p>He continued: “I knew [working with him this season] wasn’t going to be something I could take for granted … That scene work was very special, and for me to have one of the last dances with him — as a human being, as the artist that he was — was something I’ll never forget. He was a great man.”</p><p>Christian also paid tribute to de los Reyes on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> the day after his death. “I’m devastated. And honestly.. I don’t even know what to say in this moment. My heart aches for your family. Thank you for treating me like a son,” he wrote alongside a photo of him and de los Reyes on set. “Thank you for sharing the screen and this art form we both cherish with me. Thank you for your mentorship and the conversations that aided me in the worst times of my life. You will forever be in my heart Kamar. Rest in peace coach. 🤍.”</p><p class=p2><span class=s1>The tribute episode comes shortly after Taye Diggs returned to the series to reprise his role as the late Billy Baker. The beloved coach died in a devastating bus accident in Season 5, leaving fans shocked. He appeared on-screen in “Kids See Ghosts,” while his children read letters that he had written to them before his death.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2h%2FdoWOsJ%2BarF2drrG8xKecnWWTpK6ktIympqeslah6orjLZpimnaKesKK6jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-coach-montes-all-american.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-coach-montes-all-american.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-coach-montes-all-american.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-coach-montes-all-american.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-coach-montes-all-american.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-coach-montes-all-american.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-kyle-chrisley-net-worth-wife-daughter.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-kyle-chrisley-net-worth-wife-daughter.html>What happened to Kyle Chrisley?
