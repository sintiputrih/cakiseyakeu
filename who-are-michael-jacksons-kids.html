You just get used to it.</p><p>“I live life with the mentality of ‘OK, I lost the only thing that has ever been important to me.’</p><p>“So going forward, anything bad that happens can’t be nearly as bad as what happened before.</p><p>“So I can handle it.”</p><h2>What did Prince Jackson say about his siblings?</h2><p>On October 28, 2021, Prince Jackson – the eldest of the Jackson children – spoke in a rare interview with Good Morning Britain.</p><p>He talked about his invincible relationship with his siblings, and the emphasis his father put on treating the people closest to him well.</p><p>“When we were growing up, my father would say, ‘We could have nothing, but you look around in this room, your brother, your sister, and me, that’s all you’ll ever have,” he said.</p><p>“And that always stuck with my siblings and I, and we have such a close relationship. Because I’m the oldest, my father would always tell me [that] I have to make sure that the group is taken care of and that I have to be the leader and lead by example. But, after his passing, and us being thrown into the ‘real world,’ my siblings honestly—they picked up the slack that I unfortunately left behind.”</p><p>Prince continued:</p><p>“Any moment I get to spend with my siblings now, especially as we’re getting older and our own lives are starting to kind of blossom and grow-</p><p>“Every moment that I get with them—any little family dinner, any little family outing—is really a special moment for me.”</p><p>Aside from being incredibly close, Prince and Paris have also worked together on music. Prince produced a music video for Paris and her band in July of 2020.</p><p>Prince believes philanthropy to be his main goal in life, and is working to help fund educational resources for children.</p><p>“You have to keep pushing forward and it’s important that we do this. And [my father’s] kind of always on my shoulder, in my ear, motivating me to keep that moral compass pointing North.”</p><h2><span>What did Paris Jackson say about her dad?</span></h2><p>Paris revealed that her superstar father encouraged her to follow her musical dreams as young as 11 years old.</p><p>Paris, now 23, released her first single on October 29, 2020.</p><p>“No matter what it was we were interested in, I remember at one point I wanted to be an astronaut, he was like ‘do it. do it. Educate yourself as much as possible then go with it’ with every aspect of life,” Paris said.</p><p>She went on to say how music was a positive “purge” for her over the years.</p><p>“It feels good to get it out. It feels like not butterflies in your stomach but in your heart. It’s cool,” she said.</p><p>Older brother Prince explained how he felt protective of the family as the oldest of the Jackson kids.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The way we were raised, me being the oldest… I feel like I should be the one that’s protecting the group,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On her music, he said he could “hear” his sister’s deep-rooted pain after years of battling with mental illness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>“I remember when my sister first played Geronimo for me, I can hear and feel all the emotion and pain and hurt that went into that song and I remember thinking this was a song that other people both could relate to but other people needed to hear,” he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Paris was featured in a Facebook Watch show, Unfiltered, which followed her and ex-boyfriend Gabriel as they made music.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp528bq3RnmSmoZOdrqa4jKOYnKOjpLu0ecqim6xn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-michael-jacksons-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-michael-jacksons-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-michael-jacksons-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-michael-jacksons-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-michael-jacksons-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-michael-jacksons-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-a-psa-10.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-is-it-so-hard-to-get-a-psa-10.html>Why is it So Hard to Get a PSA 10?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./justin-escalona-net-worth-158793.html>Justin Escalona Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./justin-escalona-net-worth-158793.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
