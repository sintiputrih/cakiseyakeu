Satchel Paige, Jack Quinn, and Julio Franco are just a few of the oldest players to have appeared in Major League Baseball (MLB). However, when it comes to the oldest player ever drafted to the MLB, the spotlight falls on Samuel Mendez, a towering figure in the history of the MLB Draft.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Satchel Paige: A Legendary Figure</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Satchel Paige is widely recognized as the oldest player ever to have played in the MLB. Born on July 7, 1906, Paige made a token major league appearance at the age of 59, pitching for the Kansas City Athletics in 1965, a remarkable 12 years after his Major League career had officially ended. His longevity and impact on the game have solidified his status as a legendary figure in baseball history.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jack Quinn: The Oldest Regular Player</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jack Quinn holds the distinction of being the oldest player to have appeared regularly in MLB games. He played his last season at the age of 50, making 14 appearances as a relief pitcher. Quinn's enduring presence on the field at an advanced age is a testament to his skill, determination, and love for the game.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Julio Franco: The Oldest Regular Position Player</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Julio Franco, a standout among the oldest regular position players in MLB history, made significant contributions to the sport. His remarkable career as a position player is a testament to his enduring passion and dedication to the game.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Samuel Mendez: The Oldest Player Ever Drafted</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While Paige, Quinn, and Franco made history with their playing careers, Samuel Mendez etched his name in MLB Draft history. In July 2021, the Milwaukee Brewers made a historic move by selecting Samuel Mendez in the MLB Draft. What set Mendez apart from other draft picks was his age. At 28 years old, Mendez became the oldest player ever to have his name called in the MLB Draft.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Mendez's Path to the Draft</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mendez's journey to the MLB Draft is as remarkable as it is unconventional. Hailing from the Dominican Republic, he initially pursued a career in semi-professional basketball before shifting his focus to baseball. His transition to baseball and subsequent selection in the MLB Draft at the age of 28 is an inspiring testament to resilience, determination, and the pursuit of a lifelong dream.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Brewers' Historic Pick</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Brewers' decision to draft Mendez was met with intrigue and curiosity within the baseball community. Despite his atypical profile for a draft pick, Mendez's talent and potential as a right-handed pitcher captured the attention of the Brewers' scouting team. The selection of Mendez not only made headlines but also sparked discussions about age, opportunity, and the evolving landscape of talent acquisition in professional baseball.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Embracing Diversity and Unconventional Paths</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mendez's historic selection in the MLB Draft serves as a reminder of the diverse paths that athletes can take to achieve their dreams. His story highlights the importance of recognizing talent, regardless of age or background, and the value of embracing unconventional journeys to success in sports.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The history of Major League Baseball is rich with stories of resilience, perseverance, and extraordinary feats. From the enduring legacy of Satchel Paige to the trailblazing selection of Samuel Mendez, these players have left an indelible mark on the sport. Their journeys serve as a source of inspiration for athletes and fans alike, showcasing the boundless potential and enduring spirit found within the world of baseball.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlp5bAbsDHnmSopJSawLV5z6WYsp2iYrK3sdFmm6uZlqmypXnTqGStoJViuq2u</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-the-oldest-player-ever-drafted-to-the-mlb.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-the-oldest-player-ever-drafted-to-the-mlb.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-the-oldest-player-ever-drafted-to-the-mlb.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-the-oldest-player-ever-drafted-to-the-mlb.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-the-oldest-player-ever-drafted-to-the-mlb.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-the-oldest-player-ever-drafted-to-the-mlb.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./frank-bergquist-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-679367-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./frank-bergquist-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-679367-html.html>Frank Bergquist Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./camilla-luddington.html>Who is Camilla Luddington?
