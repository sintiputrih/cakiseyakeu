Norfolk escaped the downfalls of both Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard essentially unscathed, but he couldn’t outrun the scandals of the younger generation forever; in 1546, he was thrown in the Tower after a paranoid Henry became convinced his son was plotting to usurp the throne, and that Howard was an accessory to his treasons. The son lost his head, but Norfolk was saved through impeccable timing — before he could be executed, Henry died. His rivals, the Seymours, kept him in the Tower throughout the reign of Henry’s son, but he was released in 1553 upon the ascension of Mary, and died a year later, an old man, at 80.

Both Anne and George parlayed Henry’s favor into political power and lost their heads for it, while Mary’s only reward for years of faithful mistressing was two children of dubious paternity. She was replaced in the King’s bedchamber by her younger sister, and then exiled from court after marrying a man of lower rank, living out the rest of her years in rural anonymity. Since life in the country came with its own hazards, this wasn’t quite the happy ending it appeared: Mary died only a few years after her siblings, of unknown causes.

This was great for him during the subsequent reign of Edward VI, when Cranmer was a leading organizer of the Reformation, but not so great under the Catholic Queen Mary, who had Cranmer convicted for treason and heresy. He attempted to save his own life by converting back to Catholicism, but Mary wanted to make an example out of him, so Cranmer was burnt at the stake in 1555.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/7cd/160/58ccd6a844bf1f42b881e0702f58f90e0f-14-jane-boleyn.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a73eb864adbfeb238e75ae2fc26d29b5-26-0-0@published data-word-count=60><b>Ralph Sadler (Thomas Brodie-Sangster)</b><br>Cromwell’s young sidekick was thrown in the Tower after his master’s downfall, but he made it out and went on to live a long and happy life.
